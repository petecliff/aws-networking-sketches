The diagrams here are a walkthrough the fundamentals of setting up 
an application in AWS with IGW, NAT, etc. and then quickly looking
at endpoints with S3. (0_ to 10_).

Then a simple diagram of VPC peering and non-transitivity (is that a real word? :-)).

Finally there are two standalone diagrams:

* PrivateLink to provide a picture to look at while talking about using PrivateLink
* Shared VPC diagram to show that sometimes you can lean on another team to worry
about this stuff for you
