# AWS Networking Sketches

In trying to pull together a talk on AWS networking for an internal presentation at work I made a bunch of sketches.

These are sketches - not diagrams - as they're not complete ideas and (as someone on the call quite rightly commented, all the connectors are not labelled! :-)). 

They were created as talking points and to aid my understanding and then (hopefully) the understanding of the people on the talk.

I'm putting these here as folk requested access to them from the talk. I also promised to collate the following references.

You'll need draw.io from https://www.diagrams.net/ to open the drawio files. The PNGs also have draw.io diagrams embedded.
